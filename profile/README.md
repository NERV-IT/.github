NERV IT is a serious project and cute cosplay to achieve two sustainable Linux distributions for two sole purposes, Desktop and Embedded use.

With the idea of "Minimalism with functionality and usability" We try to make our projects comply with these as much as possible.

# Story
This project first started for creating another distribution based on Fil Necati, a Turkish meme first started from an obscenity (They literally f*cked It's peluche toy). Later we've left that direction and now We're pioneering the Human Instrumentality Project for the greater good.
